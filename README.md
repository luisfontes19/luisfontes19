## About my work

I also maintain a personal blog with some of the research I do about vulnerabilities not that well documented/explored

Another nice project I'm working on is [DamnVulnerableCryptoApp](https://github.com/DamnVulnerableCryptoApp/DamnVulnerableCryptoApp) which as the name says, is a vulnerable crypto app, with common issues developer do when working with crypto. 
This is a tool to teach the most common crypto attacks, how they happen, how you can exploit them, and how you can secure your code from them.
